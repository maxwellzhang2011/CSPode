WARNING: IF YOU JUST STARTED PROGRAMMING, DONT USE THIS IDE. IT HAVE A LOT OF BUGS AND IT IS HARD TO USE IF YOU FIXED A BUG IN THE SOURCE CODE
"src/main.py", PLEASE EMAIL ME AND SEND ME THE .py FILE. IF THIS IS NOT .py FILE, THIS MESSAGE WILL NOT BE CARED AND EVEN THIS IS A .py FILE I 
WILL DOUBLE CHECK IT AND MAKE SURE ITS NOT A VIVRIS. PLEASE DON'T SEND ANY VIVRIS TO ME.

I PREFER THIS ONE TO GIVE ME THE UPGRADED VERSION OF CSPode.

I PREFER THIS ONE TO ASK QUESTION AND REPORT BUGS

how to install CSPode v1.0:
so in the "windows" folder you will see a file called "CSPode v1.0", this is the main app file, move that file into "C:\Program Files".
there will also be a file called "CSPode v1.0.exe" and move that file on the desktop. now, you can click on the file on the desktop
and open the IDE as a short cut. and don't change any file or folders name in the "windows" folder.

If you think this is a virus, you can run the .py file in the "scr" folder, and you can check the source code.

commands:

		setting errortime 180
		"""
exit --this will close the app
savefile "place + name + type" --this will save your file
	"""
	example: this will save what you type "C code Coded in CSPode.c" into this place "C:/Users/CSPode v1.0 use" (not only C, any file)
	savefile C:/Users/CSPode v1.0 use/C code Coded in CSPode.c
	"""
openfile "place + name + type" --this will open the file and show it on the screen
	"""
	example: this will open "C code Coded in CSPode.c" in "C:/Users/CSPode v1.0 use"
	openfile C:/Users/CSPode v1.0 use/C code Coded in CSPode.c

remem --this works as goback and goforward to memorize what you have type before. You can have as many memorys as you want but it will loss its memory after you close the app.
	write "name" --this will memorize what you have now (used: if you use vscode or notepad ++ it is like control + z and control + y)

		"""


everything in setting will be save in a .json file in the "program file/CSPode v1.0/datas/last_stament.json"
and everything in remem will be saved in "program file/CSPode v1.0/datas/mem"
remember, the IDE don't have autosave so you have to use savefile command to save your file and it will overwrite
the file you already have, if there is a file's name sames as what you save, it will over write the file, and that
file can't be return.

repeat:
if you have any bug report just join my reddit server and tell the bug if you can fix it, give me the code in gmail
if you can't code with python, just report the bug in the in reddit and i will try to fix it. never use the v.0 version
on any code you want, use the v.0 to find bugs and if there is a v.6 it will be mush safer to use in real life. even the vn.0
the n got upgraded dosen meen the bug will be less, look at the .n to see how safe it will be to use.
